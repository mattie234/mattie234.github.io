<h1>Microbial Communities are Distinct Between Individuals</h1>

<p>Microbial communities were largely linearly separable between individuals.
Three clusters corresponding to individuals were apparent in PCA results,
 with individual M2 most distinct from the other two. The horizontal dimension in the plot,
  corresponding to PC1, was heavily positively loaded in the relative abundance of Firmicutes 
  (0.67) and heavily negatively loaded in Actinobacteria (-0.74), which is reflective
   of the antagonistic relationship between these phyla. Therefore, separation 
   of M2 from the other individuals is driven by a lower abundance of Actinobacteria 
   and a higher abundance of Firmicutes. This explained 96% of the variation between 
   microbial communities. Separation between M3 and M9 occurred on the vertical axis,
    which was most heavily loaded by the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria (0.67) and 
    Firmicutes (-0.50), indicating that a higher abundance of Cyanobacteria and relatively 
    lower abundance of Firmicutes distinguishes the microbiome associated with M3. </p>
