<h1>Compartative View of Stock Price Fluctations Using Percentage Change</h1>

<p> Our second visualization utilizes the same data as our first visualization <a href="href="Visual1.html"">[1]</a>,
  but provides a more normalized and readily comparable view of how industries
  were affected by COVID-19.  In order to visualize the effects of the pandemic,
  we plotted the monthly percentage change from the beginning of 2019 to February
  2021. We created this visualization to be interactive and chose Tableau as the
  platform to do this. Tooltips include the date, the industry, and the number of
  recorded COVID cases in the US on that date. Furthermore, the viewer can select
  a single line in the legend to see one industry specifically. Because our other
  visualizations utilize subplots, we thought it would be helpful for ease of
  comparison to have overlapping lines that use a normalized measure of assessing change.</p>

<p> As mentioned before, the technology industry appeared to fluctuate the least throughout
  the course of the pandemic. Conversely, the airline industry fluctuated the most both
  positively and negatively with deep dips and high percentage growth after the pandemic
  began to fall more under control/the economy began reopening. The hotel industry also
  experienced high fluctuations that were comparable to the airline industry which may be
  because they attract a similar set of customers. Finally, something interesting on this
  visualization is that there were still a decent number of cases when some industries
  experienced positive growth. This trend indicates that reopening the economy may not
  have coincided with a significant reduction in caseloads. </p>
