<h1>Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are antagonistic to Actinobacteria</h1>

<p>In order to determine if Phylum-level signals were present that could be discriminated by PCA, 
pairwise relationships between individual phyla were explored using Pearson correlation coefficients
 and visualized in a heatmap. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was strongly
  negative correlated with the relative abundances of both Bacteroidetes (r = -0.72) and Firmicutes
   (r = -0.97). Relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes demonstrated a strong positive 
   relationship (r = 0.69). Similar relationships have been demonstrated in the oral microbiome, 
   with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes forming an ecological guild that is antagonistic
    to Actinobacteria [4].</p>
