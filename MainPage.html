<h1>Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Industry Stock Prices </h1>

<h2> Overview and Purpose </h2>
<p> Our project observes the daily adjusted close stock prices of six industries
  during the period of January 2019 to April 2021 in order to analyze the effects
  of the COVID-19 pandemic. An adjusted close stock price is the final price for a
  stock traded during market hours revised to reflect the stock’s true value and
  accounting for corporate actions. Our purpose is to understand and visualize how
  the pandemic affected industries and the variation within these industries. This
  can be a tool to study the monetary impacts on different parts of the economy
  and can support efficient distribution of government relief funds for recovery. </p>

<p> We chose to observe the technology, pharmaceutical, airline, hotel, restaurant,
  and alcohol industries with the expectation that they are likely to be greatly
  affected by the pandemic, whether that be positively or negatively. Our comprehensive
  timeline ensures that we have an accurate examination of stock prices before and
  after the pandemic’s inception. For all three figures we averaged the daily adjusted
  close stock prices of five companies in each industry. This method allows us to get
  a general understanding of how the industry overall is doing, but it may limit and skew our findings. </p>
